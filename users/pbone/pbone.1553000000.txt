1553058792 #jsapi Working on Bug 1470369, trying to avoid situations where barriers are called during sweeping due to there still being nursery objects.
1553129521 #jsapi Almost ready to land Bug 1531626 but first I will run some tests to check I havn't missed anything in the refactorings there.

1553225640 #jsapi More work on Bug 1470369 - it's not possible to statically know if a cell might be nursery allocated, so I can't statically ensure that hash table sweeping is safe.  And updating the barriers isn't safe either because they're called off-thread during sweeping.  We just have to do our best with not compacting these tables during off-thread sweeping.
1553232865 #jsapi Fixing Bug 1531626 after it was backed-out.
1553489205 #jsapi Progress on Bug 1470369: in endSweepPhase some xpconnect code can run and cause barriers to be executed in its interrection between ref-counted and GC'd memory.  It's a bit of a mess and so it's just easier to get the nursery evicted before we finish sweeping.
1553493403 #jsapi Looks like it's fairly straight-forward to eveict the nursery before the end of sweeping, just move endSweepPhase() into the beginning of the Finalise phase, so that it's convenient for the GC to yeild beforehand.
1553493501 #jsapi ...Oh, that only works if it's not possible to yeild during finalisation.  I'll check that... whoops, any background sweeping threads can break this.
1553493527 #jsapi I think I like 'confession', it's a need record of work. But also makes a great rubber-duck (debugger).
1553559855 #jsapi I feel myself getting nerdsiped by Bug 1530397, which is probably a good thing so might look at that today.  Oh but I'd also like to finish off some other work..
